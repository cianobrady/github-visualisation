# github-visualisation

This project creates a bar graph visualisation to show the relationship between the percentage of lines of code and percentage of commits made by a user to a repository. In order to implement this visualisation, you must run the githubapi.py file. When ran, you sign into an account and then provide the account of the user you would like to interrogate. You are given a list of their repositories and you choose one. After choosing one the json file is updated. You then simply open a html file in a browser to view the visualisation.

Due to an issue regarding the d3.json() function, a local json file cannot be read. Therefore the updated json file must be committed and pushed before the visualisation can be updated.
